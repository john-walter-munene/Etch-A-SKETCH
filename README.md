# Etch-A-Sketch
In this project, I am creating a pretty neat toy for my portfolio to flex my DOM manipulation skills. 
I am building a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

Using this project you can  create your own pixel art.

1. Select any colour for the pen or background.
2. Grab used colours from the canvas.
3. Colour fill tool fills in shapes with selected colour.
4. Rainbow pen colours each cell a random colour.
5. Apply shading / lightening that persists over background colour changes.
6. Create a grid size up to 60 x 60
